This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

What does Ljung box-statistic do; should they be significant or not? Should residuals look normal? Are the * in eacf mean its significant? What should ACF look like for stationarity?

```{r}
library(TSA)
library(tseries)
library(astsa)
library(imputeTS)
library(tsoutliers)
```

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
terror2 <- read.csv("input/editted_input.csv")
terror3 <- na.interpolation(terror2$num.attacks, option="spline")
ts.plot(ts(terror3))
#ts.plot(terror2$num.attacks)
outlier_terror3 <- tso(ts(terror3), types = c("TC", "AO", "IO"))
outlier_terror3
```

```{r}
terror4 <- outlier_terror3$yadj
log_terror4 <- log(outlier_terror3$yadj)
adf.test(diff(log_terror4))
```

```{r}
ts.plot(diff(terror4))
ts.plot(diff(log_terror4))
acf(diff(log_terror4))
pacf(diff(log_terror4))
```


```{r}
eacf(diff(log_terror4))
sarima(log_terror4, 1, 1, 0)
```
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
